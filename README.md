Amnesty International Canada Digital Publishing Manual
======================================================

## Overview

This  manual outlines the work process and practices of the digital communications department of Amnesty International Canada.

### Why document?

Documentation is crucial! Not everyone can afford to spend hours every day cultivating digital literacy. Documentation helps bridge the knowledge gap for non-techincal people. 

## Structure

This documentation was created using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html), which uses .rst files and Python to compile the documentation (its an awesome tool). See [amnesty-international-digital-publishing-manual.readthedocs.org](http://amnesty-international-digital-publishing-manual.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for the final product.

## Getting started

See [Write the Docs](http://docs.writethedocs.org/en/latest/) for help getting started with documentation using Sphinx. You will need [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and Python (probably already installed) on your system. You'll need to have basic Git skills, but you don't need to know Python. There are tons of Git tutorials around. [This one](https://www.atlassian.com/git) provides a solid start.

Once you feel comfortable, clone this repository and edit at will!
