Overview
-----------------------

Implementation is broken down into two discrete, but deeply inter-related, jobs: editorial work and technical work. These jobs are done by (at least) two people.

Editorial Worker
------------------------

Role
^^^^

The Editorial Worker (EW) is part of the Digital Communications team, and reports to the Coordinator. The EW helps the Coordinator craft material for publication on various digital platforms. The EW can play several roles, including: producer, editor, copy-writer, and proof-reader. There may be multiple EWs on the communications team, with varying levels of responsibility and specialization.

The EW works closely with the Technical Worker (see below) to implement directives from the Coordinator and Strategist. The EW consults with the Technical Worker to provide practical feedback to the Digital Comms group on day-to-day publication needs.

Occasionally, when assigned by the Coordinator, the EW works with others in the organization to help develop material. This could include coaching or assisting program coordinators, activists, field-workers, interns, and volunteers to help develop digital assets for publication.

Systems
^^^^^^^

The EW interacts primarily with *words* and with *people* to facilitate the creation of effective messages. This work relies efficient collaboration and communication systems, including:

* project/task management tools
* collaboration tools (chat)
* house style rules
* editorial guidelines
* digital asset management tools (especially material review-and-revision workflow tools)
* digital publishing tools 
* online content management tools 

Tasks
^^^^^

Fundamentally, the work of the EW is to help get the "stuff" on the "thing."

This can include: 

* Proof-read and edit content to ensure that messages and operations are coherent, re-enforce strategic communications plans and adhere to international Global Identity standards
* Assist the Communications team with entering content into the digital publishing tools and online content management tools
* Assist in the maintenance of websites by reviewing existing content to make sure it is up-to-date and accurate
* Assist in the archiving of web content and websites
* Post content to social media channels
* Track and report online behaviour from new media activities
* Deploy and report on HTML e-mails and electronic newsletters
* Produce digital graphics for website, social media channels, e-mails and e-newsletters
* Create marketing banners in Photoshop
* Resize, crop and sharpen digital photographs
* Record audio and video interviews
* Assist in the development of tactical strategies to leverage and enhanced platform functionality 
* Work with the Director of Communications and Marketing and the members of the Communications team to strengthen editorial policy
* Work with the Information Technology Manager and members of the IT team to the document digital communications systems
* Provide training and advice in the use the organization’s web sites and social media platforms
* Develop and maintain documentation and learning resources for creators of digital content, social media and new media 
* Work with partners and external vendors when necessary 

Technical Worker
-----------------------------

Role
^^^^

The Technical Worker (TW) is part of the Information Systems team and reports to the Information Technology Manager. The TW helps maintain and develop digital publication and communications platforms. The TW can play several roles, including: front-end developer, back-end developer, systems administrator, database administrator, and webmaster.

The TW works closely with the Editorial Worker (see above) to implement directives from the IT Manager. The TW consults with the Editorial Worker to provide feedback to the Information Systems group on day-to-day technical needs relating to digital publishing and communications.

Occasionally, when assigned by the IT Manager, the TW works with others in the organization to help develop their digital literacy and communication skills. This could include coaching or assisting program coordinators, activists, field-workers, interns, and volunteers.

Systems
^^^^^^^

The TW works primarily on *systems* and *processes* to facilitate efficient collaboration and publishing. The TW maintains and develops:

* project/task management tools
* e-commerce tools
* collaboration tools
* web servers
* databases
* websites
* archives
* code repositories
* digital publishing tools 
* online content management tools 

Tasks
^^^^^

Fundamentally, the work of the TW is to help keep the publication and communications systems running smoothly safely.

This can include: 

* Support the operation of digital publishing tools, online content management tools, and websites by maintaining and updating systems 
* Apply information architecture(s) and metadata systems
* Maintain information collection and e-commerce platforms
* Assist in the archiving of web content and websites
* Maintain of user roles and accounts
* Assist in the development of tactical strategies to leverage and enhanced platform functionality 
* Work with the Information Technology Manager and members of the IT team to the document digital communications systems
* Provide training and advice in the use the organization’s digital collaboration and publishing systems
* Develop and maintain documentation and learning resources for creators of digital content, social media and new media 
* Work with partners and external vendors when necessary 

Best practices
----------------------

Time management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Editorial and technical support is highly desirable at Amnesty International. Given limited budgets and ambitious goals demand will always exceed supply. Be careful about how you spend your time and efforts.

* Avoid meetings unless your presence is absolutely required
* Especially avoid standing/recurring meetings, debates, and large "check-in" meetings; these are for the benefit of talkers, not you - your job is to report, inform, and get down to business
* If someone can speak on your behalf or deliver your notes at a meeting (probably your supervisor or manager) this is preferable 
* Minimize all contact outside that sanctioned by your supervisor
* Do not entertain co-workers "showing up" to ask or demand things from you, even if done politely - they must go to your supervisor for service and entry of the task into the task-management queue
* All work should be approved by your supervisor before you begin
* Editorial and technical bugs/fixes should go to your supervisor to decide priority
* Make sure you have a quiet, uninterrupted place to concentrate and do your work

Pass phrases
^^^^^^^^^^^

The editorial and technical workers have more access to computer systems than most. With this access comes the heightened need for safety. Two-factor authentication is recommended:

a strong secret key = (something you have) + (something you know)

* prefer pass-phrases over pass-words, the dice method is recommended
* hardware keys, like USBs or your cellphone, can add another level of security for mission-critical systems and are encouraged
* password managers (keepassx or Password Safe) can make managing pass phrases more user-friendly

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Good documentation is essential for editorial and technical work. Commit a regular portion of your work time to completing documentation.

Whenever possible, use Sphynx and (if appropriate) ReadTheDocs. If you are collaborating with non-technical people on documentation, use a version-controlled system like Draftin.com or Google Documents to collaborate. 

Documentation culture is an uphill battle at most organizations. Amnesty International is in the process of a cultural change towards understanding and appreciating the need for documentation. Consult Write The Docs for instructions on how to get started with Sphinx and bring about documentation culture. 


Naming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Naming things is one of the hardest things to do in computer science, and it gets especially tricky when many different people and machines are involved. Properly naming things tells the publisher what the parts of your story are and where they belong. Much of the work of the rest of our organization occurs outside of relational databases. A document-oriented File System Infobase Management method is recommended.

Assets 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assets are the components of a story. These pieces include text documents, metadata, images, and so on. File formats defines allowable file types for stories.
