The Catalogue
---------------------------------------

A catalogue is an essential part of organizing digital assets. A catalogue helps us put each piece of published material in its proper context as it relates to both our goals and all other published material. A catalogue is composed of metadata (such as an information architecture or controlled vocabulary), which describes the material, and the material itself.

Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

We use metadata to classify documents. Metadata is used to identify and group content into meaningful collections. These collections can be non-exclusive, meaning a document can exist in more than one collection at a time.

The systems we use to classify and collect documents are outlined here.

Controlled Vocabulary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

A controlled vocabulary is:

* A way to describe a set of ideas in a predictable way
* A specific collection of words and relationships between words
* A way to understand the contents of documents systematically

A controlled vocabulary do provides a list of words to use to describe a document: ie, a predictable source of metadata.

Over time, and in conjunction with other tools for digital asset management, controlled vocabulary keeps a library of content searchable and useful even as it grows to be very large and complicated.

The process:

#. First, choose a list of words that is specific enough to the describe content in useful detail and broad-enough to describe all the content we want to include in our catalogue; 
#. Then, content creators and editors choose words from the list to describe the documents they produce;
#. These words are attached to the document - the process can be manual or computer assisted, but a human who understand the content has the important role of identifying its semantic meaning;
#. The documents are published and held in our catalogue, which is able to search and group items by the information in the metadata.

A controlled vocabulary isn't the only kind of metadata that is important - there is also information about the kinds of documents we produce (their length, for example), or the programs that spur their creation, or the community the document is meant to serve. But semantic metadata applied through a controlled vocabulary is the most important kind of metadata for understanding the meaning of a document.

Information Architecture

The following llist outlines all of the areas of publication activity. Some areas are public-facing and some are internal-only communications.

Content
---------------------------------------

There are actually only a few content types we use:

* **Post**: a story, including: News, Reference, Project, Blog, and Media;
* **Bio**: the story of a person, or group of people; be they an author, volunteer, board member, individual, or collective;
* **Event**: a story about a thing that will happen, or has happened, in which people can participate;
* **Job**: an opportunity to participate in Amnesty International's work and the movement, paid or volunteer
* **Message**: a story sent to a specific person of group of persons, includes e-mails (often collected in digests or archives), discussions, announcements.

Whether a peice of material is erial or single, part of a collection or stand-alone is also a factor.

Style guide
----------------------------------------

The International Secretariat of Amnesty International has developed a Global Identity kit, including a style guide, templates, and guidelines for writers. Each branch should produce its own "house style" to cover local issues, concerns, and formatting requirements (such as how to write addresses). Please consult these documents.
